   <b><u> 1. Photography:</b></u>
Photography is not just a hobby for me; it's a passion. My camera is my constant companion, and I'm always on the lookout for that perfect shot.

<br>  <br><b><u>2. Traveling:</b></u>
Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures is something that excites me to my core.

<br>  <br><b><u> 3. Painting:</b></u>
Since childhood painting has been my most favorite hobby among all these. For me it is way of relaxation which in a way stimulates creativity and imagination. 


<br>  <br><b><u>4. Reading:</b></u>
Books have the power to transport us to different worlds, broaden our perspectives, and ignite our imagination. 

<br>  <br><b><u>5. Hiking:</b></u>
 Hiking allows me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and reconnect with the beauty of the great outdoors. I'm always up for an adventure in nature.

<br>  <br><b><u>6. Music:</b></u>
Music has the power to uplift, inspire, and evoke a wide range of emotions. From classical masterpieces to modern hits, I appreciate all genres and enjoy discovering new artists and sounds.

<br>  <br><b><u>7. Gardening:</b></u>
There's something incredibly therapeutic about getting my hands dirty and nurturing plants to life. Gardening allows me to connect with nature on a deeper level and create a peaceful sanctuary in my own backyard.

<br>  <br><b><u>8. DIY Projects:</b></u>
I'm a firm believer in the satisfaction of creating something with my own hands. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality. DIY projects not only allow me to express my creativity but also challenge me to learn new skills and techniques along the way.
